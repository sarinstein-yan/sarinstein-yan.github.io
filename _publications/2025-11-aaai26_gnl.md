**Abstract:**
Classifying non-Hermitian energy spectra under open boundary conditions is an open challenge in physics.  
This classification is a critical prerequisite for the rational inverse design of systems exhibiting desired dynamics and topological responses. While graph topology has emerged as a promising approach for characterizing these spectra, systematic methods for distilling non-Hermitian spectra into their corresponding graph representations have been lacking. Moreover, the resulting graphs often exhibit complexities that defy manual classification, necessitating machine learning approaches.  
In this work, we introduce a two-step framework for classifying non-Hermitian spectra based on their graph topologies. The first step employs **`Poly2Graph`**, an automated, high-performance pipeline that distills non-Hermitian spectra into *spectral graphs* suitable for graph neural networks (GNNs). The second step involves generating a large dataset of these spectral graphs and training a GNN for classification. We propose **`GnLTransformer`**, a novel architecture featuring dual channels that leverage line graphs to explicitly capture higher-order topological features. **`GnLTransformer`** achieves over **99%** classification accuracy on our dataset, outperforming standard baselines by **32%**. Notably, beyond conventional GNNs, **`GnLTransformer`** offers inherent explainability regarding higher-order topology. As a further contribution, we release a new *multi-graph* dataset comprising over **117K** spectral graphs.
