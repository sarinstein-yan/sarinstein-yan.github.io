excerpt: >-
    Existing graph benchmarks assume non-spatial, simple edges, collapsing
    physically distinct paths into a single link. We introduce HSG-12M, the first
    large-scale dataset of $$\textbf{spatial multigraphs}$$ — graphs embedded in a
    metric space where multiple geometrically distinct trajectories between two
    nodes are retained as separate edges. HSG-12M contains 11.6 million static and
    5.1 million dynamic $$\textit{Hamiltonian spectral graphs}$$ across 1401
    characteristic-polynomial classes, derived from 177 TB of spectral potential
    data. Each graph encodes the full geometry of a 1-D crystal's energy spectrum
    on the complex plane, producing diverse, physics-grounded topologies that
    transcend conventional node-coordinate datasets. To enable future extensions,
    we release $$\texttt{Poly2Graph}$$: a high-performance, open-source pipeline that
    maps arbitrary 1-D crystal Hamiltonians to spectral graphs. Benchmarks with
    popular GNNs expose new challenges in learning from multi-edge geometry at
    scale. Beyond its practical utility, we show that spectral graphs serve as
    universal topological fingerprints of polynomials, vectors, and matrices,
    forging a new algebra-to-graph link. HSG-12M lays the groundwork for
    geometry-aware graph learning and new opportunities of data-driven scientific
    discovery in condensed matter physics and beyond.
